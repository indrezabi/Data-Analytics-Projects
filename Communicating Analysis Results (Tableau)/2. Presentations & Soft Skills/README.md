# Presentations & Soft Skills
## Task
You work as a data analyst at “AdwentureWorks'' company. You should be familiar with this company’s data from previous sprints. 

### Executive Leadership and Sales

You are asked to provide 1 dashboard which you will then use for 2 presentations (created using PowerPoint or another suitable tool for you) for each of the departments. If you wish, you can have 2 slightly modified versions of the dashboard to better suit each of the two presentations.

Keep in mind that both presentations and dashboards should be prepared with your audience in mind. Make sure that you apply what you learned in this sprint and that you can provide not only data but also insights and communicate them.

Provide 2 presentations and present them. One presentation of your choice should be a very brief one: up to 5 minutes. The other one should be a more detailed one, taking ~10 minutes. In case your audience has more questions, this limit may be exceeded. For the presentations, you will be assessed on:

Slide content: What is presented and how much information is on a slide.
Slide appearance: How content is distributed on a slide, animations, charts, tables, size of objects, etc.
Techniques used to hold the audience's attention: Asking questions, storytelling, etc.
Your body language and voice: They should help you and match the message you want to deliver.
Assurance and self-confidence.
