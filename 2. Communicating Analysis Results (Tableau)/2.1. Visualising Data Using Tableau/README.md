# Visualising Data Using Tableau
## Task
In this project, I received the Adventure Works Sales Orders dataset, which consists of several sheets containing various data. My task was to analyze this data to gain insights into the business performance, which I accomplished by following all six analysis steps. The primary objective was to create an informative Tableau dashboard based on these criteria:
- Learner provided a dashboard which is user friendly and interactive enough to pull some more insights by the users themselves
- Analytical approach to the problem (6 steps approach). Did the learner use their analysis to provide justified, useful and actionable insights?
- At least 1 new data source (csv file) added to the Tableau dashboard. SQL queries written to extract needed data, these queries should be well documented and provided in a separate Google sheet with data itself.
- Data sources connected to the dashboard, naming conventions are clear and calculated fields have relevant names
- Learner understood various techniques to be used in Tableau correctly and managed to improve the original dashboard
- Analysis, findings and main points clearly structured
- Learner provided useful insights from their own dashboard and included new or already suggested KPIs
- Dashboard coloring has been fixed, adjusted to align with the company's branding or to individual preferences, and issues related to color blindness have been resolved
